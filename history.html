        I started this coffee shop in order to try and bring a piece of my own heritage here to San Francisco. When friends and family would visit, my mother would begin to roast fresh coffee beans but before the brewing process, the roasted beans would be paraded around the house and in front of the guests in order to spread the smell of the coffee around the house. Then it would be brewed in a special pot and served with a variety of different sweats and sides. 
        <br><br>
        I think the special thing about this was how it would always be an occasion, coffee wouldn’t be something that was meerly for the sake of that shot of caffine- it was truely enjoyed, slowly and surely where if you weren’t drinking in good company, then you weren’t drinking it at all.
        <br><br>
        As I grew older the days where the family would stop for these session of coffee became more and more scarce as my siblings and I got caught up in the process of growing up. I moved out here to San Francisco after college and worked in the computer science field. I traveled the world as I got the oppertunity to work remote and one of the places I traveled through the Horn of Africa to countries like Sudan, Ethopia, Somalia and where my roots were, Eritrea. 
        <br><br>
        I came back home from this trip enlightened looking to work on trying to figure out how I could hold on to that experience and share it with others. So I opened this little cafe, and the rest is history.
